# Food-Calculator
A budget calculator, the only thing that is functional is the calculator. Punch in values or click a preset food item to change the values. You are given $1000 for food and your budget $500. 
This is the math for the daily spending limit:
=
((total - budget) - (totalSpent)) / daysInMonth = dailyLimit
=
((1000 - 500) - totalSpent) / 30 = dailyLimit
